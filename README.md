# Project Title

Baallit.

## About the project

Baallit it's a very entertaining game in which you will not get bored.


# Headache and troubles.

Initially, the collision was between a moving inner ball, and many rotating rectangles on the perimeter. It was difficult to get the collision point. So, to lunch the game (because of time), I decided to swap the rectangles for circles. It's easer get the collision point between two circles than circle - rectangle. The reason it's my JS knowlage.


### How to play

Press **left** or **right** key to move the balls. Prevents the boucing inner ball from hitting the spheres that you rotate around when you press the keys left or right.
